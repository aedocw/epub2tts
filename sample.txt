Title: Sample Text

# Chapter 1 

This script takes an epub (or text file) and reads it to an m4b audiobook file, using TTS by Coqui or OpenAI. The audiofiles are created in discrete chunks then transcribed using whisper speech-to-text. The transcription is compared to the original text, and if they don't match well it tries again. Finally all silence longer than a second is removed from all audio segments, and the audio is cleaned up before being combined into an m4b audiobook file.

# Chapter 2 

I recognize this is not very user friendly, but I wanted to share in case folks thought it was useful. If there are a few more people than myself that find this is useful I will keep working on turning it into something that could be used by someone without dev experience.
