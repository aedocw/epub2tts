The script takes an epub or text file and reads it to an
audiobook using TTS by coqui text to speech. I recognize
this is not very user-friendly, but I wanted to share in
case folks thought it was useful. If there are a few more
people than myself that find this is useful I will keep
working on turning it into something that could be used by
someone without dev experience.
